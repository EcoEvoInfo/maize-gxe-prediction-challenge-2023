We individually tuned an XGBoost model and a LightGBM model for each LOYO dataset based on features present in `combo_dfs`. The model showing best performance on the hold out year was stored. We discovered that our tree-based models were consistently underpredicting yield for many accessions. Our best submission for the competition used the average of the three models that gave relatively higher yield predictions (though models were still not able to predict higher yield values, likely due to nature of the decision boundary for tree-based models).
