We individually tuned an XGBoost model and a LightGBM model based on features present in `combo_dfs`. The model showing best performance on the hold out year was saved. We discovered that our tree-based models were consistently underpredicting yield for many accessions. Our best submission used the average of three models that gave relatively higher yield predictions (though models were still not predicting higher yield values, likely due to nature of the decision boundary for tree-based models).
